    <p>
        GigMan Request allows stage artists to receive requests and messages from their audience in near-real time, and view them on-stage over their wireless devices.<br /><br />
        The performing artist can direct their audience members to use their smart phones to go to gigman.com/xxx, where xxx is an identifier the artidst can define.<br /><br />
        Once there, the audience member can make requests based on a list of songs defined by the artist, and send messages to the individual stage artists, leader or entire band.<br />
        Messages are limited to 160 characters, and can be prefaced with a number of menu selected topics.<br /><br />
        Premium GigMan artists can also publish event dates to their GigMan Request page, so audience members can see where upcoming gigs are occurring.<br /><br />
        See GigMan Request | Artist Preferences for a summary of how the artist can control audience input.<br /><br />
        Messages and requests can be viewd in the navigation popout (<span class="mif-menu">).  An analytical view is also available in the Dashboard section of the site.
