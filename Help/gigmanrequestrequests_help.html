    <p>
        Audience members can make requests of the artist in near-real time.<br /><br />

        The artist makes a list of songs publically available (see the Song Editor help topic to understand the public option), from which an audience member can make selections for requests.<br /><br />
        If downvotes is turned on (see the Artist Profile editor help topic), each request can be either an upvote or a downvote.  If downvotes is turned off, each request is always an upvote.  Downvotes can be useful for determining the popularity of songs with your audience.<br /><br />
        The artist can choose to hide the Composer and Categories fields of hte public song list (see the Artist Profile editor help topic).<br /><br />
        An aggregated view of the requests can be viewed in the navigation popout (<span class="mif-menu">) or the Dashboard area of the GigMan site.</span><br /><br />
        The number of requests a single user can send in a 24-hour period can be set in the Artist Profile editor.
