        </p><p><span>Tempo: </span>The normal speed of the song; there are five selections<br /> 
            </p><p><span>Public: </span>If the current artist has a GigMan Request membership, and the switch is set to <b><i>Public</i></b>, audience members will see the song in the artists song list on their GigMan Request page.<br />
        </p><p><span>Title: </span>The title of the song. As you type, a dynamic hint list is displayed, showing possible duplicates.  This field is required.
        </p><p><span>Composer: </span>The composer or original recording artist for the song. As you type, a dynamic hint list is displayed, showing possible duplicates.  Multiple artists can be added by separating them with a '/' character.  This field is required.

            You can specify four types of lyric blocks: Verse, Alternate Verse, Bridge and Chorus.  To mark a chorus, place 'Chorus:' or 'Ch:' on a line above the block.  Similarly, mark a bridge with a "Br:' or 'Bridge:'.<br />
            All other blocks are considered verses - alternate verses are automatically identified.<br />
        </p><p><span>Chords:</span> Chords can be entered here as well.  There are two types of chord formats:<br />
            <span class="subTopic">Above Line: </span>Prefix the line with a tilde ('~') character and use spaces (not tabs) to separate the chords, as illustrated below.<br />
            <span style="margin-left:20px"><pre style="margin-left:20px">~Am         C     D    E7</pre></span>
            <span class="subTopic">In-line: </span>Prefix each chord with a pipe ('|') character, with a space after the chord, as illustrated below.<br />
