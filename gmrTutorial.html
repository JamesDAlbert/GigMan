    If you are reading this, you were probably invited here by someone on stage right now.<br /><br />
    GigMan Request lets you make requests of the performer.  You can also let them know, with a down-vote, if you really don't like a particular song.  This can be very useful to the artist, as it lets them know what is working, and what is not.<br />
    Making your request is as easy as 1-2-3-4-5:<br />
    <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Click one of the Request boxes ('Request One', 'Request Two', 'Request Three' etc.) to make it active. The active Request box has a bold/italic title.</li>
        <li>Browse the list of songs until you find one of your favorites (or, if the artist has enabled downvotes) one you really dislike).</li>
        <li>Click the up-vote icon (<span class="mif-thumbs-up"></span>) or the down-vote icon (<span class="mif-thumbs-down"></span>).</li>
        <li>Repeat, up to <span class="nReq">(depending on how the artist has set things up) 5</span> more times.</li>
        <li>Click the <span class="mif-checkmark"></span > Done! button.</li>
    </ul>
    Once your requests are made and sent, they go to our servers, which push them to the performer, where they can read the request results on their wireless device.<br /><br />
    It should be noted that, while you can pick up to <span class="nReq">5 (depending on how the artist has set things up)</span> songs, you can only make one request per song.<br /><br />
    That's it!<br /><br />

    GigMan Messages allows you to send prepared and personalized messages to the band or individual band members.<br />
    You can even add an attachment to your message!<br />
    To send a message:<br />
    <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Select a topic from the drop down list.</li>
        <li>Add some (optional) text of your own in the text box.</li>
        <li>Add an (optional) attachment file to your message.</li>
        <li>Repeat up to <span class="nMsg">(depending on how the artist has set things up) 5</span> more times.</li>
        <li>Click the <span class="mif-checkmark"></span> Done! button.</li>
    </ul>
    Like the requests, messages are sent to the servers and then pushed to the performer in near real time.

            var artistMap = null;
            if (band.indexOf(".html") < 0) {
                band = decodeURI(band.substring(band.lastIndexOf("/") + 1));
